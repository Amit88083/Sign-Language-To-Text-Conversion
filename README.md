# Sign-Language-To-Text-Conversion
Sign language is one of the oldest and most natural form of language for communication, but since most people do not know sign language 
and interpreters are very difficult to come by we have come up with a real time method using neural networks for fingerspelling based 
american sign language.

This project converts American sign language to text in realtime. It uses CNN to train the required models for prediction. 
The dataset is custom made.

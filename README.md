# Sign-Language-To-Text-Conversion
Sign language is one of the oldest forms of language for communication and it has been used
since the origin of life but many people are not aware about sign language, thatâ€™s why interpreters
are very difficult. To handle it, we have built a CNN based model to convert the sign language to
text form which is based on american sign language.

This project converts American sign language to text in realtime. It uses CNN to train the required models for prediction. 
The dataset is custom made.
